      <p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896.</p>

         <p >Teams of seven players pass and dribble a ball up the court to throw the ball into the opposition's goal, which happens often: spectators might see 60 goals or more in a single match.

Handball was created and developed in Denmark, Sweden and Germany in the late 19th century. Originally played outdoors as field handball, the sport first appeared at the Berlin 1936 Games. The modern indoor version made its Olympic debut at Munich 1972. The first women's competition was held at the Montreal 1976 Games. Handball has featured at every Olympic Games since. The International Handball Federation (IHF), founded in 1946, is the administrative and governing body of handball and beach handball. The IHF has 209 member federations.</p>

         <p>Basketball first featured in the Olympic Games St. Louis 1904 as a demonstration sport, but it wasn’t until Berlin 1936 that men’s basketball appeared on the Olympic programme. Meanwhile, the women’s game made its Olympic debut almost 40 years later at Montreal 1976. Professional players have been allowed to participate at the Olympics since Barcelona 1992, when the USA ‘Dream Team’ won gold. Since then, NBA players have continued to feature on their national teams, attracting attention with their outstanding skills.</p>

         <p>Volleyball is played by two teams on a 18m x 9m court divided by a net (2.43m high for men, 2.24m for women). Each team at the Olympic Games is allowed up to 12 players, but only 6 play on court. The game starts with a serve that sends the ball over the net to the opponent’s side. Teams are allowed to touch the ball three times before it must cross over the net into the opponent’s court.
         Volleyball for both men and women became an official Olympic sport at the Olympic Games Tokyo 1964.</p>

         <p>Tennis appeared at the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 but was dropped from the programme after the Paris 1924 Games. It returned 64 years later, with Miloslav Mečíř (Czechoslovakia) and Steffi Graf (West Germany) winning gold in the two singles tournaments at Seoul 1988.
         A coin toss before the match determines which player will serve and which will receive. Scoring counts zero points as ‘love’, one point as ‘15’, two points as ‘30’ and three points as ‘40’. If a player scores four points first, he or she wins that game. However, if both players have scored three points, the score is said to be ‘deuce’ and the game continues until there is a difference of two points between the players.</p>

         <p>Badminton became an official sport at the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Games. The competition at Tokyo 2020 will consist of men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed doubles.

A match consists of best-of-three games, with the first player or pair to reach 21 points winning the game. If the score is 20-all, the side that gains a two-point lead wins that game. If the difference is less than two, the game continues until the two-point difference is achieved. If the score gets to 29-all, the side that reaches 30 first wins the game.

A match is won by winning two games. Either the server or receiver can win a point by winning the rally</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">GOLF</h4><hr>
         <p>Golf consists of striking a ball into a series of holes using a selection of clubs and counting the number of strokes it takes to do so. An official sport at the Paris 1900 and St. Louis 1904 Games, golf then vanished from the programme until it returned at Rio 2016.

There are two main tournament formats: match play, in which two golfers compete against each other hole-by-hole; and stroke play, in which the total number of shots taken is counted. Stroke play is used at the Games, with athletes playing four rounds of 18 holes over four days, giving a total of 72 holes. 60 men and 60 women participate, based on the world rankings as compiled by the International Golf Federation.</p>

      Sports are the ultimate form of competition. Just like businesses compete in the stock market financially, sports teams in different leagues compete against each other trying to outsmart, out hustle, and out perform their competitors.

I believe that humans are naturally competitive. If there was nothing to do on earth, this world would be boring.
Think about it. If everybody had the same skills and could compete on the same lever regardless of the activity, life would be miserable. Wouldn’t you agree?
